# Cover Letter: 

Dear MacArthur Foundation,

Following this cover letter you will find attached three documents, a problem statement addresses why socioeconomic inequality is a global issue and how desegregating the favelas in Rio could help solve socioeconomic inequality in the city. A literature review that outlines two data science methodologies that I believe would be perfect to tweak apply to Rio, in order to assess and analyze regional economic inequality in Rio. And a research proposal which goes over how I will effectively adapt each methodology to fit the city of Rio, the prices and timeline of my proposed research, and an in depth statement on why you should choose to fund my research over other proposed projects. I lived in Rio de Janeiro for a year as a child, and attended a year of high school at Escola Americana de Rio de Janeiro, which is an international school located in the heart of the favelas. I remember my first day, walking past the tall, barbed wire fences and armed guards, into the school with bullet proof glass pains. I remember PE class when we were forced to stop playing on the field because our teachers feared that a shootout in the favelas was imminent and they were worried about a stray bullet hitting a student. But most of all I remember the beauty of the city of Rio and how much I want to preserve it. I love Rio and want to live there again someday, but I know this will not be possible if some drastic economic changes do not spark city wide desegregation to help fix the issues in the favelas. At the bottom of this proposal you will find a more logical and in depth breakdown as to why my proposal is superior. However, the purpose of this cover letter is to alert you to the issues the favelas present in Rio, and prove to you I am passionate and capable of helping to solve it. 

Sincerely, 
DJ Olson


# Problem Statement:

### Introduction:	
Nearly 1/2 of the world's population — more than 3 billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day. More than 1.3 billion live in extreme poverty — less than $1.25 a day. In my eyes, any issue that affects half of the world’s population is something that should be addressed. Obviously, my research will not be the first to address poverty, and it will certainly not be the last. However, I hope that by narrowing my focus to a small region and utilizing innovative data science methodologies it will at least provide a small step in the right direction. My research is focused around the human development goal of socioeconomic equality. The specific sustainable development goals associated with my topic are number 8: promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all, and number 10: reduce inequality within and among countries. 
Amartya Sen argues that human development is about the expansion of citizens' capabilities. He contends that by expanding the agency of citizens, a country will experience positive growth. Communities will integrate, cities will grow, and the economy will prosper, all because the citizens are put first. By this definition, Rio de Janeiro is failing. When people think of Rio, the images they often associate it with are sprawling beaches, beautiful greenery, and the famous Christ the Redeemer statue that watches over the city. What many people fail to recognize is many of the city’s residents suffer the effects of crippling poverty. 

## Why Rio:
Rio is a central city in Brazil and has experienced tremendous growth over the past couple of decades. One of the biggest problems the city faces is socioeconomic inequality, which causes social segregation due to unequal development within the city. Rio is one of the world's most diverse cities, because it serves as an epicenter for South American business. This has forced Rio to develop at a rapid rate, because more people and money are constantly flooding into the city. This results in economic prosperity for some of Rio’s regions, and at first glance, seems like something that would positively influence the city’s development. However, not everyone in the city gets an equal share of the wealth. As those at the top continue to gain more power and money, it furthers the divide between the rich and the poor. Trying to fix this divide has led to the central research question: What factors relating to socioeconomic status cause the greatest economic inequality, and how can these factors be addressed to promote equality in an urban environment?

25% of the city's population live in neighborhoods called the favelas, which are essentially slums. These regions have experienced historical governmental neglect, and thus, have fallen behind as the rest of the city develops. This has led to massive socioeconomic division within the city between the wealthy and poor residents, causing development to falter as the city loses unity. Before we delve any further into the favelas and potential fixes for their problems, it is important to have a picture of what the problem looks like. Below is a map of the city of Rio, with the regions separated and categorized by average GDP per capita. It shows how Rio has developed economically from 1950-2010, but also shows how this development has not been equal among the regions. The favelas (located in northern and central Rio) show very little progress, whereas the most urbanized parts of the city along the coast have continued to economically advance.

## Understanding the Favelas:
Now that the lack of development in the favelas is clearly displayed, it is important to understand the history behind them. Originally the favelas started to develop in the 1940s when there was a shortage of land in Rio. Poor people began to build makeshift houses and communal living areas vertically along the many hillsides of Rio. However, as Rio continued to develop into the 70s, this area became highly valuable for real estate development and commercial use. Politicians were under pressure to clear out the favelas due to the anti-urbanization and inefficient land use effects they had, but efforts failed because they had become such a big part of Rio, and so much of Rio’s lower class lived in them. In fact, in 1988, Brazil’s constitution established five years as the term for “adverse possession,” the process of acquiring ownership through use rather than through payment. Thus, many favela residents who had been living in Rio’s favelas for generations were no longer at risk for eviction. But, this did not end all troubles as starting in the 1980s all the way up to present day, the favelas have been the hub of the lucrative drug trade that plagues Rio and Brazil.


Below is an image of the favelas, which shows how they were created without much of a plan, and are not structured well to promote desegregation.

![unnamed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60228369/81872758-656c4600-9548-11ea-9326-708a3de54754.jpg)

## Why is it a Complex Human Development Problem?
From the description and the image above, the favelas may seem like a part of Rio that would be resented by all, especially their residents. This would mean that the changes I am proposing would be widely accepted. However, what makes this a complex human development problem is the fact that so many of Rio’s poor residents rely upon the social hierarchy that has developed within the favelas to survive. Any drastic change or desegregation attempt is undoubtedly going to be met with extreme backlash. This was especially well highlighted in the film The City of God. 

Tobler’s  First  Law  of  Geography states,  “everything  is  related  to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” In The City of God (the favelas) each person’s destiny seemed to interwoven. Everyone’s life was connected, but those who on paper would appear to be on opposite ends of the scale, such as cops and drug dealers, were actually very dependent on each other in order to keep their lives running smoothly. Regular citizens in the favelas rely on the drug cartels to have strict rules regarding crime, which keeps violence outside of gang on gang violence, and illegal activity outside of drugs, out of the favelas. The cops rely on drug cartels to keep drugs in the favelas and outside the richer parts of the city. The cartels rely on the cops to stay out of the favelas as long as they keep violence and drugs outside the favelas low. Newspapers rely on the favelas for storylines. Politicians rely on the favelas to remain poor, so they can continue their never ending war on poverty to keep voter support and stay in office. Essentially the favelas are one giant organism in which every person is a cog that relies upon everyone else to keep their life running smoothly. 

What my research proposes is changes that will eventually increase the overall quality of life for everyone in Rio, especially the socioeconomic disadvantaged, through massive desegregation. However, I won’t lie, before it gets better there will likely be a period where the poor feel uprooted and without the protection of familiarity. Any massive economic change to an already developed social system is bound to cause some turmoil, but I believe this to be the necessary cost of equitable development.

## Why it is Important this Research is Pursued:
While we have already established that 25% of Rio living below the poverty line is detrimental to development, I think it is important to conclude the problem statement by understanding just how poor the quality of life is for some favela residents. A study done by an NGO in Rio by the name of Catalytic Communities used data to generate maps of the favelas and Rio. The maps show the proximity of different regions within Rio to different public amenities. This includes the proximity and amount of schools, health clinics, and even things like sports facilities and parks. Across almost every category the regions in which the favelas were located were much farther from public amenities. Additionally, it was able to identify that over “30% of Rio’s population is not connected to a formal sanitation system, which encompasses not only some of Rio’s favelas but also some of the city’s wealthier neighborhoods.” 

Clearly the problems in the favelas need to be addressed, however, I think the entirety of Rio will benefit from socioeconomic equality which will stem from desegregation. Rio has developed unequally, and by leveling the playing field, class resentment will dissipate and I believe this will lead to the quality of life improving for all of the city’s residents. Change is not easy, but equality is necessary. Hopefully an understanding of the importance of this research has been developed, as we delve into the methodologies and research plan. 


# Literature Review:

### Introduction:
In my methodology section I chose two data science methods that have not yet been applied in Rio, but I believe have the potential to help find solutions to socioeconomic inequality within the city. I briefly described both of the methods below and during the methodologies I talked about how each one could be applied in Rio, which I realize was wrong for the methodologies section, but can now be applied perfectly to my research proposal, thus, saving a lot of time now from past work. What needs to be added to the research proposal from my methodologies section is diving deeper into gaps in the literature, which I will do after describing each of my two selected methods and stating how I believe them to be applicable to Rio.

## Methodology 1 - Agent Based Simulations:
The first geospatial model we will discuss is Flavia Feitosa’s MASUS simulations. MASUS stands for multi-agent simulator for urban segregation, and it is used to predict the effects of population dispersal within cities and regions. In Flavia’s words, it is “a tool to explore
alternatives for promoting inclusive cities.” Flavia’s work was done using the Brazilian city São José dos Campos, located to the West of Rio. The similarities between Rio and São José dos Campos makes Flavia’s work applicable to Rio. Creating an economically “inclusive city”, is exactly what Rio needs to ensure all of its regions develop. 
	
Flavia created and tested MASUS using a three step approach, each one consisting of an experiment that built off the previous. 

> The first experiment compares simulated outputs that replicate a past segregation scenario in the city with empirical data, and tests whether the model can provide an adequate representation of segregation patterns as observed in São José dos Campos. The aim of the second experiment is to demonstrate how MASUS can be used to test theoretical issues of segregation, exploring the relationship between income inequalities, and the configuration of segregation patterns. The third experiment demonstrates the ability of MASUS to provide insights regarding the impact of social-mix policies.

In essence, the first experiment was a test to make sure MASUS worked, the second proved that economic inequality does lead to segregated communities, and the third tested its capabilities to predict future scenarios using different independent variables and explain certain outcomes.

How MASUS actually works is by creating decision trees for theoretical agents within an Urban population model for the city being tested. Models use a set of equations to calculate a Monte Carlo simulation to identify agents' probability of making each possible decision. The simulation then identifies all possible effects by simulating all possible outcomes of certain decisions, and calculates each possible outcome’s likelihood of actually occurring. 

One can also set up a MASUS model with a certain outcome predetermined in order to predict what decisions need to be made to achieve the chosen outcome. Flavia identified that economic inequality leads to segregation in São José dos Campos. Thus, a good MASUS model to use in Rio would be one with the goal of decreasing segregation. When running this model in Rio you could monitor if economic equality increases as segregation decreases. If this is the case, then you can go back to the decision tree and see what choices agents made in order to decrease segregation to see what methods of desegregation are most highly correlated with economic equality. This would help Rio’s government implement the most effective anti-segregation policies that would integrate and economically balance the city’s regions.

An example of a MASUS agent decision tree and shown below as well as the larger system that take:

## Methodology 2 - Administrative territorial unit models to rate and monitor development levels of urban areas:
The second methodology I have chosen is from a study conducted in Russia. It looked at ways for the government to monitor the socioeconomic development of urban areas. This study was done with the purpose of figuring out how to improve real estate value in certain areas to increase investor interest within these regions. However, I believe the method can be tweaked to help reach our goal of economic equality Rio. 
 	
The way this study was done was by surveying different regions of Russian cities, in order to provide a rating of socioeconomic development within these urban areas. Regions are broken down into Administrative Territorial Units (ATU’s) which are then subdivided further to create a hierarchy of local indicators. Thus, the models are able to provide explanatory indicators starting from a local level that scale up to encapsulate the region as a whole. Essentially the model uses a bottom up approach in order to show causes and effects of different variables at the local level, in order to piece together the more complex system that is the region as a whole. 

Below is a functional model of area assessment, which explains how an ATU rating is given. A basic breakdown of how a tree like this is assembled is also provided.

## How this method could be applied in Rio:
Essentially what the study in Russia did was show how to optimally manage an administrative-territorial unit. What if instead of being used to increase real estate value, the data was used to optimally manage factors that contribute to economic prosperity. Models of regions within Rio could be created to seperate the city into different ATU’s. You could then select different local indicators that are believed to most greatly contribute to economic prosperity, and compare these indicators between ATU’s of different economic status. These models would help explain what economic factors on the local level are most greatly correlated with regional inequality, and thus, make it easier to assess what measures need to be taken. Instead of starting massive city-wide initiatives, each region could be allocated money to spend on what the data reflected would be most effective in increasing socioeconomic prosperity. Hopefully, this would in turn increase widespread equality within Rio. 

## Gaps in the Literature: 
Gaps in the literature are often defined as missing pieces of research, resulting in an area of the research being underexplored. Oftentimes this leads to incomplete analysis and needs to be addressed before research can claim to be valid. However, in the case of my proposal I think that what is missing is not a piece of data resulting in a faulty method, but instead the application of these methods in Rio. Many proposals likely pitched the idea of expanding upon a methodology already conducted within the specified region. But, what I want to do is take methodologies already proven sound in predicting and analyzing socioeconomic inequality, and actually adjust them to fit Rio instead of their region of origin (i.e. Russian and São José dos Campos). So the gaps in the literature I intend to address in my research are: what changes are necessary to make these data science methods applicable to Rio, and also develop the necessary formulas for taking these methodologies global. Not only do I want to help solve Rio’s critical economic inequality, but I also want future researchers to be able to look at my research plan and understand how they can use the methodologies I use in Rio, to analyze the development of similar regions around the world. 

That being said, there is a major gap in each methodology which I look to overcome in my research in order to further socioeconomic equality in Rio. The gap in the first methodology is creating simulations that can estimate the probabilities necessary to create agent decision trees. While Flavia’s statistical equations made sense for São José dos Campos, it does not seem likely that you could ever have a model that would correctly determine decision probabilities for all cities. Her work may have been proven accurate in the city in which she created the decision trees. However, it does not seem probable that decision probabilities will remain constant as you change location or as time passes and people evolve. Thus, in my research I will look to adapt the MASUS model to create a formula for setting probabilities for Rio, and other regions that MASUS could potentially be applied to in the future. 

Additionally, in the Russian study I think there needs to be a more in depth explanation of how local indicators were chosen, and a formula for choosing local indicators based on the criteria the ATU’s are ranking. Thus, I want to conduct further testing in Rio to provide a method for choosing local indicators for a specific region. The local indicators used in the study were likely good for assessing the socioeconomic status of Russian regions, however, I assume the indicators necessary will change as the location of the assessment changes. Additionally, this method was developed for real estate profit purposes, and while it did primarily focus on promoting socioeconomic equality to drive up price, I will also need to research further how the method can be applied with the sole purpose of promoting desegregation and equality.


# Research Proposal:

### Introduction:
I have spent the past semester learning about and researching socioeconomic inequality, and studying the ins and outs of Rio’s economy. In doing so I have found a number of methodologies adequate for analyzing and hypothesizing solutions to economic inequality, however, none have been applied to Rio. My goal the entire semester has been to desegregate the favelas, and in doing so, I believe socioeconomic equality will follow. My prediction was further solidified by the MASUS model which links desegregation to economic equality in a city neighboring Rio. Now my plan moving forward is to test this MASUS model in Rio by researching the necessary changes to make the simulation’s predictions valid, and couple this MASUS model with a methodology that will create the ATU’s I previously talked about. 

One of the most important shifts I made this semester was including studies conducted outside Brazil to find data science methods applicable to Rio. Originally I picked the human development topic of socioeconomic inequality, and only looked at sources relating to Rio because this seemed the most logical. However, I learned that if I have a narrow enough topic, I can still focus on Rio, but use studies and data science methods from around the world. Applications of data science are not constrained to the regions from which they originated. I want to find the best solution to the problem, thus, I am looking at proven solutions from other places and trying to find the best ways to combine them to create a mesh of proven methodologies that will hopefully work in Rio. 

## Plan for Transforming Methodology 1: 
The primary issue with applying the MASUS model to Rio as is, is that it was designed to create agent based simulations in São José dos Campos. The research needed to solve this problem involves creating a new set of decision trees specific to Rio or reworking the predictive statistical formulas. After looking further into how agent based simulations in general are conducted, I moved beyond the MASUS model. I realized that perhaps the best way to do it in Rio is to create individualized focus groups to collect empirical data, rather than trying to recreate modified statistical formulas. A source from the Korean University of Science and Technology discussing ways to conduct agent based simulations stated:

> The Agent-based simulation is similar to the microsimulation, a bottom approach where the interactions are driven by autonomous actions or reactions from the agents according to their built-in rules, but are not necessarily equation or probability based. Agent-based models trying to simulate some real-world phenomena driven by empirical data.

Essentially what this means is there is no need to shift the formulas in the MASUS model, but instead create new decision trees based on new empirical data I will collect in Rio. The way empirical data works is; researchers gather empirical evidence through experimentation or observation, and scientists record and analyze this data. My plan is to create a focus group of citizens to represent each of the ATU’s methodology two will create in Rio, and then collect the necessary data through a survey. The survey will consist of hypothetical situations presented to the groups, focusing on key decisions the MASUS model has already identified to be linked to economic inequality. Their responses should provide me with data necessary to create the new decision trees needed for the MASUS model, and I can then plug these new agent decision trees into the preexisting MASUS model formulas. This will allow me to run MASUS simulations in Rio without reworking any of the complex statistical formulas that have already been proven to work in the MASUS model. When you think about it, the primary variable that changes from city to city is a given city’s agents (citizens). So, why try to create a formula that accounts for variability in agents, when instead we can just rework the decision trees by collecting new survey data on the agents.  

## Plan for Transforming Methodology 2: 
Transforming methodology 2 to be applicable to Rio should be a lot easier than methodology 1. All we need to do is figure out a way to choose the local indicators necessary to give the ATU’s rankings based on the criteria we want - economic equality and desegregation. My plan to do this is to use a methodology I previously considered using in Rio and applying it to simply rank ATU’s socioeconomic level based on mobile app usage. I chose this way because it should be fairly easy to contact a local CSR database in Rio and request the data we need if we explain to them why we need it, and it is far cheaper than the alternative which is census data. 

The study was conducted by the US National Library of Medicine in Shanghai China and focused on measuring  the socioeconomic statuses of different regions. The current approaches for estimating regional socioeconomic levels heavily rely on census data, which demands significant effort in terms of time and money. With the ubiquitous usage of smart phones and the prevalence of mobile applications, massive amounts of data are generated by mobile networks that record people’s behaviors. This study estimated socioeconomic levels within blocks of the city based on what apps were accessed. It created random forest regressions based on the data for each region. 

The study found that frequent mobility corresponds to developed economic status. In addition, the area with a large quantity of finance POIs tends to be in high socio-economic levels. Furthermore, we find a tight correlation between App usage patterns and economic levels. People in wealthy areas are more active on networks and spend more time on Apps in the travel category.
While this article was conducted in China, the methods have been tested and are easy to replicate. A similar study could easily be conducted in Rio using app usage data to further breakdown regions socioeconomic statuses. This data science method would couple perfectly with the “administrative-territorial units” methodology, because it could help create the ATU’s and provide the local indicators (app usage data) necessary to rank the ATU’s socioeconomic status.

## Budgeting and Time:
One of the reasons I believe my research proposal is so strong is that it is not very expensive to carry out. I will need access to the formulas of the two methodologies I plan on using in Rio, and a knowledge on how to use them. I anticipate to be close to if not free once I explain to their inventors my intended purpose with them. Next I will need to collect or at least CSR data on app usage in Rio to create the ATU’s and create and survey a focus group for each of the ATU’s once they have been created and ranked. A group known as CSRhub aggregates CSR data for regions using a combination of public and private sources for a price starting at $20,000 ranging to $100,000. Hopefully if I explain the use of the data they will air on the cheaper side but to be safe I will allot $50,000. Which leaves me with around $50,000 to pay the people necessary to create, run, and participate in my ATU focus groups, which should be more than enough. Additionally, I recognize that this research proposal is for a 1 year exploratory phase, but I anticipate results can be found within a couple of months so I do not see the time to be an issue. 

## Finally, Why Me?
To conclude my proposal, I know this committee is receiving upwards of 30 research funding requests so I wanted to highlight what makes my research plan stand out. When listening to other researchers give their initial pitches, I realized that the popular approach was picking a region, looking at data science methods applied in this region, and then implementing a new method based on drawbacks of previous methods. While this is respectable, and will likely yield some results, I want you to consider that I took a different approach I believe to be better. I chose to research data science methods from other regions that have been proven to work, the MASUS and ATU models, and then focus my research on tweaking these proven models to fit my region. Essentially, what I am saying is why fund research that is not backed by anything, when instead you can choose to fund my research which will simply work to adapt proven methods to fit my region. Not only will this likely yield the best results, but it will also be cheaper and faster since I have previous research to work off of. Finally, my research seeks not only to bring socioeconomic equality to Rio, but also set a template for future researchers to tweak the methodologies I chose in a similar way to address socioeconomic inequality in regions around the world. Why fund research that can solve a human development problem in one region, when you can fund mine, which will seek to solve economic issues in Brazil and allow for future global economic equality.
