Our question related to the reading for today.  Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

Random forest is used to predict settlement patterns using high resolution population density data. Random forest makes regression trees which are created by taking data samples and then making prediction from each of them. It layers on top of eachother different classifications of the data to knit together multiple different explanatory variables within the data to create the best prediction model that is both precise and accurate. Population density is logged as the repsone variable to each of the different explanatory variables, and from all the different data trees create we extract the best ones by assessing their “covariate importance scores.” Using this layering and ranking system, random forest is able to create very detailed population density maps for small towns to countries. 

Dasymmetric population allocation is a geospatial technique used to distribute data that has been given boundaries (it works to asses population density realative to residential land use). It takes a value within a region such as population, and then shows how the population is distributed. This can be helpful because for many uses of human population density, not only is it important to know how many people live in a defined region, but also where in the region they tend to cluster. 

The article found that the most important covariates for predicting human population distribtuions were climactic and enviormental.
