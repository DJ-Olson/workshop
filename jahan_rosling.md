Jahan and Rosling Response 

Feb 4. 

Selim Jahan introduces the idea that for far too long the paradigm of economic development has dominated the idea of human development. Jahan states that while income is critical it is not an end, and that human development is about expanding the richness of life, not the richness of the economy within which human beings live. What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world? Elaborate further on Jahan’s definition of human development. What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries’ average achievement?

Hans Rosling states that “we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change” and proceeds to provide several examples. What were some of the examples Rosling presented where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth? What was Rosling’s warning regarding the dangers of using averages when describing development?

Rosling starts his discussion by indicating that many of us have preconceived notions about the socioeconomic status of the different parts of the world. He used a study he conducted in which many Asian and Eastern European countries were identified as less wealthy than their matched pair to show just how little most people know about the development and wealth distribution in different countries. To further this point, he continued by showing a variety of data sets starting in the 1960s that tracked wealth vs life expectancy and child survival rates for countries around the world. In doing so, he was able to show that the most important thing for countries to do when developing, is pursuing public health. The standard many countries have used and still use to this day to show development and standard of living is GDP. What Rosling was able to do in his study was show a global correallation between GDP and life expectancy, displaying that regardless of region, country, or climate, pursuing public health and increasing your citizens life expectancy is the most beneficial thing a country can do. To do this it means that leadership within countries has to place a high priority on health educating and making available different forms of public health.
