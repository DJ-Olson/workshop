Jahan and Rosling Response 

Feb 4. 

Just because a country is doing well, does not mean its citizens are prospering. Selim Jahan elaborated upon this idea in his talk which highlighted the importance on looking at real world situations from the prospective of the individual. Just because a country's government is thriving and large corporations are prosperous does not mean that the quality of life of the common citizen within the country is good. Instead Jahan stated that if we want to focus on human development, we should instead focus on the richness of life for human beings within a population, rather than measures of the countries wealth like GDP. To measure this we use Human Development Index or HDI. HDI takes into account many more measures that more accurately represent the quality of a persons life withing a country such as; health - life expectancy at birth, education - expected years schooling for school-age children and average years of schooling in the adult population, and income - measured by Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. Thus, if a country focuses more on the individual instead of the overall economy, quality of life with increase, and the economy will naturally follow suit.

Hans Rosling, a Swedish academic, expanded upon this idea of countries shifting the focus from money to how people live when pursuing human develpment in his Ted Talk. Rosling starts his discussion by indicating that many of us have preconceived notions about the socioeconomic status of the different parts of the world. He used a study he conducted in which many Asian and Eastern European countries were identified as less wealthy than their matched pair to show just how little most people know about the development and wealth distribution in different countries. To further this point, he continued by showing a variety of data sets starting in the 1960s that tracked wealth vs life expectancy and child survival rates for countries around the world. In doing so, he was able to show that the most important thing for countries to do when developing, is pursuing public health. The standard many countries have used and still use to this day to show development and standard of living is GDP. What Rosling was able to do in his study was show a global correlation between GDP and life expectancy, displaying that regardless of region, country, or climate, pursuing public health and increasing your citizens life expectancy is the most beneficial thing a country can do. To do this it means that leadership within countries has to place a high priority on health education and making available different forms of public health reform. For example, he showed that even though the GDP in the United Arab emirates has started to decline due to a drop in oil rates, because leaders placed a high value on public health while the country was still profitable, the average life expectancy increased, proving that health reform starts with countries leaders placing value upon reform. 

Furthermore, Rosling also tried to breakdown the stigma of "us and them," in which the western world sees itself as developed and well off, and everything else falls into the category of third world, struggling countires. Rosling saw this as a potential danger because statistics over the years have created this outlook, but when you actually breakdown the populations of countries by regions, poverty and wealth exists in almost every country. Thus, averaging populations and describing an entire region of the world as poor is never accurate. As the world develops, the overlap between weathly and poor countries continues to grow, and thus, poverty no longer is segregated to certain global regions. Instead poverty now exists within almost every country in the world in certain subsets of the population. In closing, we should not use statistics simply to make broad claims about entire populations. We need understand that the world is no longer black and white, and we must analyze each situation individually. We can't just section off the world into chunks, because while this visually appealing and easy to understand, it often leads to conclusions being made about entire populations that aren't entirley true, and we are left with preconceived notions about parts of the world that are false.
