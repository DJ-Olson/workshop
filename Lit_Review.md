# The Untold Truth about the Favelas: A socioeconomic analysis of Rio.

## Introduction: 

Amartya Sen argues that human development is about the expansion of citizens' capabilities. He contends that by expanding the agency of citizens, a country will experience positive growth. Communities will integrate, cities will grow, and the economy will prosper, all because the citizens are put first. By this definition Rio is failing. When people think about Rio de Janeiro, the images they associate it with are often sprawling beaches, beautiful greenery, and the famous Christ the Redeemer statue that watches over the city. What many people fail to recognize is that many of the cities residents suffer the effects of crippling poverty. 25% of the city's population live in neighborhoods called the Favelas, which are essentially slums. These regions have experienced historical governmental neglect, and thus, have fallen behind as the rest of the city has developed. What this has done is led to a massive socioeconomic division within the city between the wealthy and poor residents, causing development to falter as the city loses unity. 

## What Rio’s Data Can Tell Us: 

Many people have tried to understand what has caused such massive division within Rio to persist using different data science methods. What we learned from the sources previously presented in the annotated bibliography is that healthcare differences, and social progress deficiencies are contributing factors to the favelas struggles. The Favelas are located in the northern region of Rio, whereas the richer regions such as Leblon and Ipanema are located in the Southern regions of the city next to the beaches. One source previously presented, a 2010 study, used the geospatial distribution of urban health index (UHI) to show that the northern regions of the city were much more susceptible to factors contributing to early death. The study collected data on eight indicators using mortality data: diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, breast/cervical cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, homicides, traffic accidents and infant mortality. The study showed that if you lived in the northern part of the city you had anywhere from a 20%-80% chance of dying young due to one of the indicatoring factors, whereas people from the southern region only had a 0%-12% chance. Based on the findings from this study we can conclude that public health inequality likely plays a role in the city’s inequality. 
	Another source previously presented looked at the Social Progress Index (SPI). It found that within Rio the factors of social progress that were least accessible were: water sanitation, shelter, nutrition and medical care. While the second study did not break down the city into regions, we can use the first study to do this and conclude that the favelas are likely most in need of these factors of social progress. 
	Finally, while it is important to try to help regions that face particular struggles within Rio by spending time and money to better develop them, another alternative is creating equality through the desegregation of the city’s regions themselves. One option researchers have been looking into in Brazil is dispersing people, so that no one region is far behind the rest. A new study used agent-based simulations to explore the impact of social-mix policies on the segregation dynamics of São José dos Campos, a medium-sized Brazilian city. The study tested two strategies, one which dispersed poverty and one that dispersed wealth. The study found that, “poverty dispersal provides immediate results on segregation levels and direct benefits for the assisted families, whereas wealth dispersal can produce long-term outcomes and promote a positive change in the overall levels and patterns of segregation in the city.” 
	In summary, based on this study conducted for a nearby Brazilian city, it would seem that one option Rio has is redistributing wealth to break down regional socioeconomic inequality. However, even if for some reason these strategies do not work for Rio like they did for São José dos Campos, the option to run agent based simulations remains. 
	Agent based simulations are based on agent-based models. These models are classes of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with the goal of assessing their effects on the system as a whole. So Rio could use this data science method to simulate all sorts of different kinds of interactions between the regions of the city to try and assess which are most beneficial in desegregating the city’s regions.
	
## Human Development Topic:

Now that we have a basic understanding of where inequalities exist within Rio and what factors may cause them, it is important we understand why a socioeconomic analysis of the city will tell us more. First we should start by understanding what socioeconomics is. Socioeconomics is the social science that studies how economic activity affects and is shaped by social progress. In general it analyzes how modern societies progress, stagnate, or regress because of their local or regional economy, or the global economy. 
	At first a socioeconomic analysis of Rio may seem like the wrong way to go about addresses regional inequality. The previous sources seem to reflect problems that seem more related to human development topics of infrastructure and social service, or poverty assessment. However, when trying to understand a city’s economy, many explanatory factors are needed. The definition of socio economics states that economies reflect social progress. Thus, by understanding what deficiency of social progress exists within Rio, we can learn why there is such socioeconomic inequality within the city. In his book The Big Picture, Geoffrey West talks about a multitude of topics relating to human development, one of which is the growing importance of the science of cities. In chapter 7 he states that “cities are rarely systemic and typically do not integrate issues of infrastructure with those of socioeconomic dynamics. It may be this sort of physics-inspired theory of cities that I am advocating is simply not conceivable. Cities and the process of urbanization may be too complex to be subjected to laws and rules.” In essence, West would agree that a factor such as the socioeconomic framework of Rio encapsulates much more than simply measuring figures such as GDP. In order to understand socioeconomic inequality in a city we must look beyond the numbers and understand the factors that affect people's lives.



## Outside Data Science Methods Applicable to Rio:
Socio Economic analysis is a topic of data science around the world. Thus, when thinking about Rio it is important we do not constrain ourselves to using studies about only Rio. Numerous studies have been conducted around the world looking into ways to use data science to more accurately and precisely measure socioeconomic status within regions. 
	A study conducted in Russia looked at ways for the government to monitor the socioeconomic development of urban areas. 
	
> The study focuses on identifying standardized methodologies to area assessment techniques formation that will result in developing the system of intelligent monitoring, dispatching, building management, scheduling and effective management of an administrative-territorial unit. This system is characterized by complex hierarchical structure, including tangible and intangible properties (parameters, attributes). Investigating the above mentioned methods should increase the administrative-territorial unit’s attractiveness for investors and residence. 

The impact of a data analysis method similar to this one in Rio would be massive. While this study focused primarily on monitoring factors of urbanization, think about what would happen if the study was tweaked to monitor each region's healthcare needs. Essentially what the study in Russia did was show how to optimally manage “an administrative-territorial unit.” What if, instead, the data was used to optimally manage healthcare distribution within regions of a city.  If the government in Rio had a way to easily monitor and assess each region's precise healthcare needs they could find: optimal locations for healthcare facilities, the amount of doctors needed in each region, the optimal locations for water sanitation plants, how much food intake each region requires, ect. Essentially, the government could more efficiently allocate spending and resources than ever before. Instead of starting massive city-wide initiatives, each region could be allocated money to spend on what the data reflected would be most effective in increasing socioeconomic prosperity, and thus, increase widespread equality within Rio. 
	Another study conducted by the US National Library of Medicine (See source 6) focused less on how to fix socioeconomic inequalities and more on simply measuring  the socioeconomic statuses of different regions. The current approaches for estimating regional socioeconomic levels heavily rely on census data, which demands significant effort in terms of time and money. With the ubiquitous usage of smart phones and the prevalence of mobile applications, massive amounts of data are generated by mobile networks that record people’s behaviors. This study focused on app usage in Shanghai, estimated socioeconomic levels within blocks of the city based on what apps were accessed. It created random forest regressions based on the data for each region. 

>The study found that frequent mobility corresponds to developed economic status. In addition, the area with a large quantity of finance POIs tends to be in high socio-economic levels. Furthermore, we find a tight correlation between App usage patterns and economic levels. People in wealthy areas are more active on networks and spend more time on Apps in the travel category.

While this article was conducted in China, the methods have been tested and are easy to replicate. Rio could easily conduct a similar study using app usage data to further breakdown regions socioeconomic statuses. This data science method would couple perfectly with the previous, because it could help create the “administrative-territorial units” mentioned in the previous study for the government to monitor. 

## Concluding Discussion:
There has been some shift in my research since the annotated bibliography, however, the primary change hasn’t been so much of a shift as an increase in specificity of focus area. My focus coming into the literature review was pretty much just looking at all data related to Rio and Brazil that could somehow relate to inequality. Now I have narrowed my focus to figuring out how to analyze factors of socioeconomic status that relate to inequality. Primarily I have focused on how healthcare within regions of Rio signals economic prosperity. Additionally, I added to my focus area the possibility of creating equality through desegregation as opposed to simply developing underdeveloped regions. Wealth distribution has already been tested in other regions of Brazil, and there are various different studies relating to it. I did not come across the idea of using the data science method of agent-based simulations however, until I narrowed my focus to only socioeconomic status of different regions. 
	Another big change has been including studies conducted outside Brazil to find data science methods applicable to Rio. In my annotated bibliography I used six sources all relating to Rio because this seemed the most logical. However, I learned that if I have a narrow enough topic, I can still focus on Rio, but use studies and data science methods from around the world. Applications of data science are not constrained to the regions from which they originated. In the “Data Science Methods Applicable to Rio” section of my literature review I discussed two sources from Russia and Shanghai. Both the sources introduced a new data science method that I had not found when looking at sources relating to Rio. I know we were not supposed to be looking for solutions to problems. But, I felt they both presented data science methods that could at least start to provide insight into why Rio faces such Socioeconomic inequality and will help immensely when we do start assessing possible solutions. 
	Finally, one gap in the literature that I wish I had found more information on was the history of migration patterns within Rio. While I was able to talk about both what causes inequality, and why it persists, I think some history explaining its origins would be helpful. I think this would come through studying the migration patterns over the course of Rio’s history. These migration patterns would show how regions developed as the city grew and what populations of peoples make up specific regions. I could then use these to compare to socioeconomic breakdowns of regions to understand what migration patterns led to the greatest underdevelopment. 
	My proposed research question is: What factors relating to socioeconomic status cause the greatest economic inequality, and how can these factors be developed to promote equality in an urban environment.
