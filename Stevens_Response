Question 1) 
In the reading today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The random forest estimation technique is a machine learning algorithm used to create decision trees. It can be used to analyze large geospatial data sets and create population density grids.

Question 2) 
The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events? 

Machine learning algorithms adjust themselves as they gain access to more data, essentially evolving as more evidence and explanatory factors are presented. Classical statistical apporaches don't evolve persay, because they are created using past studies for a set time, whereas a machine learning algorithm can constantly adapt and move forward as time progresses. 

Question 3) 
In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

A couple of the covariates used in the model were access to water, land cover, night lights, access to hospitals, ect. All of these covariates were used to make different layers of the map that made predictions about populations more accurate as each layer was added. Most of these data sets were quite large and can be used to make predictions anywhere from a regional to global context. The importance of these covariates is that they tell us why people live where they live, and what factors are most important in driving human development.

Question 4) 
The authors’ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?

Increased accuracy in population projections are important because they allow for people to respond to the real world. Things such as policy and planning initiatives at regional and global scales can be constructed to combat real issue that people face incredibly accuratley, because of how easy it is to predict population densities. Different populations within communities can be easily identified, and issues they face can be quickly and effectivley adressed because of the data available 

Question 5) 
Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

This method can be applied to my topic because I am looking at socioeconomic class differentials in Brazil. I have already looked at a study that showed the correlation between communities access to public services and resources such as parks, hospitals, police, and their economic class. Using the random forest technique in Rio, I could see all the differences between the favela regions and the wealthiest regions and use this to make predictions about what is most important for Rio to focus on when trying to integrate its population.
